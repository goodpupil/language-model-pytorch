![Status: Abandoned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Abandoned-flat.svg)

This repo aims to build a simple CharCNN encoder + LSTM + softmax decoder language model.

Due to the lack of time, this repo is currently abandoned.

The model is roughly based on *Exploring the Limits of Language Modeling, Rafal Jozefowicz, Oriol Vinyals, Mike Schuster, Noam Shazeer, Yonghui Wu*, though the Char-CNN is not implemented.

Our code is based on [PyTorch's official example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model).
